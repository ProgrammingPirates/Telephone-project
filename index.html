CSS changes take effect immediately, no save needed. For JavaScript changes to take effect, select Control+S (Windows, Linux) or Command+S (macOS). DevTools does not re-run a script, so the only JavaScript changes that take effect are those that you make inside of functions. For example, in the following figure, notice how console.log('A') does not run, whereas console.log('B') does. If DevTools re-runs the entire script after making the change, then the text A is logged to the Console.
